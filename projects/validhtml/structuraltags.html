        <p>This is another great step for us for us developing a fan base for when we start playing shows we can have a decent sized audience! We are all dying to get on that stage! We are continously hard at work perfecting our songs and dumping out our wallets for better gear and equipment. Luckily, Shirley Road Records let us get on this cd for free, so a large thanks is due for them! Getting this CD would greatly support bands of a lower level to help them get that extra help they need to make the next push of moving forward as an underground metal band.</p>
